## Disclaimer

THis project is built along with [Learn React](https://scrimba.com/learn-react-c0e) course on Scrimba by [Bob Ziroll](https://scrimba.com/@bobziroll). It is not an official project of Scrimba, I am just learning React and building this project for fun. I made sure to add more features along the way.

**Note:** All features are still under development and not functional yet—stay tuned!
